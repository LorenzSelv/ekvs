* Refactored viewmanager to match the new specs:
  - partition merging, view changes
  - view changes as a chain of small op
  - sync to prevent race conditions of KVS hash map ops
* Implemented vcmanager:
  - handling causal payloads, timestamps
  - conversion CP -- VC  
* Implemented kvsquery module:
  - run distributed query, tolerating disconnected nodes
  - async rpc call to update disconnected nodes as soon 
    as they are reachable again
  - key deletion
* View info endpoints
* Refactor kvs operations endpoints
* Tested the whole system:
  - TA test script
  - my test script to stress untested features
